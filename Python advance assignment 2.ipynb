For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because ‘+’ operator is overloaded by int class and str class. The same built-in operator or function shows different behavior for objects of different classes, this is called Operator Overloading.It is normally used for performing mathematical operations like Vector operations etc."
