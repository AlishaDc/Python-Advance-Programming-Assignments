    "Text Files\n",
    "Text files are more restrictive than binary files since they can only contain textual data. However, unlike binary files, they are less likely to become corrupted. While a small error in a binary file may make it unreadable, a small error in a text file may simply show up once the file has been opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text files may be saved in either a plain text (.TXT) format and rich text (.RTF) format. A typical plain text file contains several lines of text that are each followed by an End-of-Line (EOL) character.\n",
    "\n",
    "An End-of-File (EOF) marker is placed after the final character, which signals the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich text files use a similar file structure, but may also include text styles, such as bold and italics, as well as page formatting information. Both plain text and rich text files include a (character encoding) scheme that determines how the characters are interpreted and what characters can be displayed.Since text files use a simple, standard format, many programs are capable of reading and editing text files."
