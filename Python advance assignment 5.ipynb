    "It is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.A class that references to one or more objects of other classes as an Instance variable. Here, by using the class name or by creating the object we can access the members of one class inside another class. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of different classes. It means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component"

    "When we create a class and put some attributes inside it, those can be used by us within the class. But it may happen that someone other than us can also be use the same attributes with similar name from outside or inside the class. So in that case there will be change in our program codes. This will change the entire meaning of that code. So in order to make it safe from other users we use double underscore ( ) as a notation for private attribues or methods So that others cannot use it and if they able to use it then they cannot be able to access it."
